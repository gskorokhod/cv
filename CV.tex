    \resumeSubheading
      {Research Intern (STARIS)}{St. Andrews, Scotland, UK}
      {University of St. Andrews}{Jun. 2024 - Present}
      { As part of the St Andrews Research Internship Scheme (STARIS), I am working on the practical application of constraints programming for scheduling and workforce management problems, under the supervision of Dr. Ozgur Akgun. }
      \resumeItemListStart
        \resumeItem{Reactive UI with Svelte \& Typescript \\}
          {I have developed a reactive web application that gives users an intuitive way to enter employee data and availability, manage tasks, schedule shifts, and define the constraints that need to be satisfied. }
        \resumeItem{Geocoding with the OSM API \\}
          {To allow users to easily schedule shifts for different physical locations, I have developed an integration with the OpenStreetMaps API to look up coordinates and addresses, and visualise them on an interactive map. }
        \resumeItem{Constraints modelling \\}
          {I have worked on client-side logic to generate an input file to the Conjure constraints modelling tool based on the data provided by the user, including handling custom user-defined constraints. }
        \resumeItem{CI and TDD \\}
          {I have developed unit tests with Vitest, integration tests with Playwright, and automated linting, testing, and deployment using GitHub Actions.}
      \resumeItemListEnd

      {Vertically Integrated Project - Constraints Modelling}{St. Andrews, Scotland, UK}
      {University of St. Andrews; Grade achieved: 20 / 20}{Sep. 2023 - May 2024}
      {As part of a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP), I have worked with a team of students and university staff on the \href{https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-oxide}{'conjure-oxide'} project - a full Rust rewrite of the \href{https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure}{'conjure' constraints modelling tool}, focusing on a clean architecture, compile-time optimisation, and support for incremental solving of constraints problems. }
      \resumeItemListStart
        \resumeItem{Rust \\}
          {Working on this project, I have learned the Rust programming language and gained a better understanding of memory management, concurrency, and the cargo build system.}
        \resumeItem{Developing an Essence language compiler \\}
          {Essence is a domain-specific language for defining constraints problems, used as input for Conjure. I have developed a Rust representation of an Essence AST and a \href{https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-oxide/wiki/Expression-rewriting,-Rules-and-RuleSets}{rewrite engine} that simplifies it down to a low-level, solver-specific representation.  As part of this, I have developed macros to auto-generate the necessary code for traversing the AST in a generic way.}
        \resumeItem{AGILE \\}
          {I have worked alongside a team of students from multiple years, using git for version control and collaboration, and following the AGILE software development methodology. }

      {  }
      \resumeItemListStart
        \resumeItem{The St. Andrews Rent Map \\}
          {One of my main tasks is administering an annual survey of students and community members about their housing situation, analysing the data, and creating a \href{https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1zf78ODx0XEIRSom3jh77OIWpTgcgyjE&usp=sharing}{visual map} of rental prices around St Andrews.  }
        \resumeItem{Research \& Support \\}
          {As a CASH committee member, my core mission is conducting research to provide informational support for the campaign, ensuring that it can continue to operate safely and effectively, as well as informing other students about their rights as tenants. }
        \resumeItem{The St. Candrews Food Bank \\}
          {I have also taken part in organising donation drives for a student-operated food bank to help students and other members of our community who are struggling with the cost of living. }

\section{Projects}
  \resumeSubHeadingListStart
    \resumeSubItem{\href{https://github.com/gskorokhod/PygameChess}{Pygame Chess} \\}
      {A simple chess game written in Python, complete with an automated opponent using the MinMax algorithm.}
    \resumeSubItem{Linux Homelab \\}
      {I am using a Linux server to self-host a file sharing service and gaming servers for myself and my friends, automatic regular backups of important files from my laptop, and my website at \href{https://gskorokhod.com}{gskorokhod.com} (currently under development).\\ This has helped me learn Docker, the UNIX command line, and the basics of web technology. }
    \resumeSubItem{Greenbox \\}
      {In high school, I have worked with a team of students to build a fully automated greenhouse for herbs and small plants, based on the Arduino microcontroller. It included climate control, lighting, and a configuration UI. Our project has won a bronze medal for the Russian delegation at the International Exhibition for Young Inventors (IEYI-2019) in Jakarta.}
